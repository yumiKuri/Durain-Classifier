# Durain-Classifier-Website
A simple Streamlit web app for classifying durian images using a pre-trained ML model. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

THis website is built with Streamlit and deployed on Streamlit Cloud, it uses this tool because it allows me to create a easy UI integrating with a tensorflow model of my friend.

🚀 Features
- Upload durian images for classification
- Take a photo for classification
Both will give a prediction result after pressing a button.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend & Deployment: Streamlit
Backend Model: Pre-trained classification model using Xception (developed by a teammate)

📁 Project Scope
This project focuses on the frontend development and deployment of the durian classification interface. The machine learning model was implemented by a teammate and integrated into the app for the KMITL innovation competition in the agricultural technology topic.
